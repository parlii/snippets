# VSCode Snippets Collection

**Problem Statement**  
Setting up boilerplate code across multiple languages can be repetitive and time-consuming, causing you to lose focus on solving the core problem.

**Solution**  
This repository provides a collection of VSCode snippets for various languages (e.g., Python, Go for now). By quickly inserting pre-written templates, you can concentrate on logic and problem-solving without worrying about syntax details.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Copy the relevant `.json` file(s) into your VSCode `snippets` directory:
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/snippets`
3. Restart or open VSCode to start using the snippets.

## Usage

In a file of the respective language, type the snippet prefix (e.g., `defn`) and select the suggestion. Fill in placeholder fields with **Tab**. Use these snippets to prototype faster, especially under time constraints or in coding interviews.
